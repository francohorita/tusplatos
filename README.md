# tusplatos - HTML Basic Project

**tusplatos** is a simple basic HTML project with a **JQuery lightbox** plugin for educational purposes only.

## Prerequisites & Installing
There are no prerequisites to run this project locally since it's purely HTML & CSS.

Despite that this project's **CSS** was generated with [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/) (you can find .map & .scss files on "assets/css"). You can just edit the **CSS** files directly, since their are not complex at all, or you can install [**Sass preprocessor**](https://sass-lang.com/install)
